/*Implicit classes make this kind of field and method grafting possible, but there are some restrictions about how you can define and use them:

    An implicit class must be defined within another object, class, or trait. Fortunately, implicit classes defined within objects can be easily imported to the current namespace.
    They must take a single nonimplicit class argument. In the preceding example, the Int parameter was sufficient to convert an Int to a Fishies class in order to access the fishes method.
    The implicit classâ€™s name must not conflict with another object, class, or trait in the current namespace. Thus, a case class could not be used as an implicit class because its automatically generated companion object would break this rule.

    */
